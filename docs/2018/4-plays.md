# Let's write a play


## Let's get started

-   Copy paste basic122 into a new file
-   Do something


## Here are some play ideas

-   The best defense &#x2026;
    -   No robots on defense. Every robot tries to capture the ball and pivot kick it into the goal.
-   Chicken
    -   1 goalie. Every other robot is a submissive defender.
-   Everybody loves Mark
    -   Every robot marks an enemy robot
-   or come up with your own!


# The best defense &#x2026;


## States

-   You would have two states
    -   Every robot is trying to capture the ball
    -   The robot that has captured the ball will try to shoot it into the goal
-   What would dictate entering the first state? the second state?
-   What would robots need to do upon entering each state, during each state, and upon exiting each state?


# Chicken


## States

-   You would have one state where
    -   Every robot that is not a goalie is a submissive defender
-   What would dictate entering the first state?
-   What would robots need to do upon entering each state, during each state, and upon exiting each state?


# Everybody loves Mark


## States

-   You would have one state
    -   Every robot is marking
-   What would dictate entering the first state?
-   What would robots need to do upon entering each state, during each state, and upon exiting each state?
